# ATM-Simulator-C
A simple ATM simulator program written in C using basic concepts like conditional statements, loops, and I/O.
It allows users to withdraw cash, check balance, and view a mini statement after successful PIN verification.

Features
PIN Verification – Secure access with a 4-digit PIN.

Cash Withdrawal – Withdraw money in multiples of 100 (with balance check).

Check Balance – View current account balance.

Mini Statement – Shows total amount withdrawn so far and remaining balance.

Notes
The program uses dollar ($) symbol instead of rupee (₹) because the developer’s keyboard does not have the rupee symbol.

The default PIN and balance are hardcoded for demonstration purposes.

Example Output:

=== ATM Machine ===
Enter your 4-digit PIN: 7909
PIN verified. Welcome!

--- Main Menu ---
